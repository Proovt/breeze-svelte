## Introduction

This verison of Laravel Breeze is powered by Svelte and Tailwind.
As a typical Breeze package, this publishes authentication controllers and views to your application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs.

## Documentation

### Official Documentation
Documentation for Breeze can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits#laravel-breeze).

### Breeze-Svelte Documentation
Installation is the same as the original Breeze package, you can either use the interactive installer or install it manually by passing the `--svelte` flag to the `php artisan breeze:install` command.

Everything else is the same as the original Breeze package.

## Some Known Issues
- There's some issue with the active states of the navigation links, not really sure why its not working.
- I haven't worked with the transitions yet, let' see, might work on it later.(until then, PRs are welcome)
